#### 1. Similarity Search Methods
##### Exact Nearest Neighbor Search
- Similarity Metric: Euclidean Distance (L2 norm)
- Measures the straight-line distance between vectors in the feature space.
- Suitable for small datasets or when exact matches are required.
##### Inverted File Index with Flat Quantization
- Similarity Metric: Euclidean Distance (L2 norm)
- Uses an inverted file structure to group vectors into clusters, reducing the number of  distance calculations.
- Suitable for larger datasets, providing a balance between speed and accuracy.
##### Inverted File Index with Product Quantization
- Similarity Metric: Euclidean Distance (L2 norm) approximated via Product Quantization
- Compresses vectors into quantized representations to reduce storage requirements and computational costs.
- Suitable for very large datasets, offering reduced memory usage and faster search times at the cost of some accuracy.
#### 2. Mitigating Slowness in Nearest Neighbor Search
To address the issue of slowness in nearest neighbor similarity calculations, we employ dimensionality reduction techniques. One effective method is:
##### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Purpose: Reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving as much of its structure as possible.
- How It Works: PCA projects the original high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space, simplifying the calculations for similarity search and speeding up the process.
#### 3. Enhancing Search Accuracy
After performing the initial similarity search, reranking is used to improve the accuracy of the results. 
##### Reranking
- Purpose: Refines the initial search results by applying more precise similarity metrics.
- Process:
* Perform an initial similarity search to retrieve a set of candidate results.
* Use a more accurate similarity metric (e.g., Cosine Similarity) to re-rank these candidates based on their relevance to the query.
* Return the top-ranked results for the final recommendation.
